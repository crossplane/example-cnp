  # Composite resources are cluster scoped, but each composite resource may
  # optionally offer a namespaced 'composite resource claim'. A claim acts as a
  # proxy for its composite resource - changes made to the claim are reflected
  # on the composite resource. A claim shares the API group and schema of its
  # corresponding composite resouce, but must have a different name. Omit the
  # claim names when defining a composite resource that should not offer a
  # corresponding requirement claim.

  # This policy determines whether Crossplane will automatically create cluster
  # roles for this composite resource and its requirement. ManageClusterRoles is
  # the default. Under this policy Crossplane will create edit and view RBAC
  # cluster roles for the composite resource and requirement (if any). The roles
  # will aggregate to the Crossplane service account, crossplane-admin role, the
  # global edit and view roles, and any matching namespaced edit and view roles.
